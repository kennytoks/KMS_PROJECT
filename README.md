# KMS_PROJECT
My First Project as a Data Analysis student at DSA.
I started the project by creating a database named KMS PROJECT in sql server, after which I imported a csv file that has the already created table that I needed for the project.
Then, I tried to change the data type of columns that has to do with money to decimal 10, 3. 
Also, I selected some columns needed to solve the first case scenario and put them in a view table for easy access. 
Each question is accompany by its query and the answer gotten after executing the query.
